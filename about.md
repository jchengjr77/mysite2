# About Me

My name is JJ, I am 26 years old.

I love writing software. </br>
In spring 2022, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) with University Honors, earning a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
In spring 2023, I graduate with an M.S. in the same field.

Illustration is my main hobby these days (@jjchengart on [IG](https://www.instagram.com/jjchengart/)). Currently working on a [comic series](https://globalcomix.com/c/fragrance).</br>
In my spare time, I train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Muay Thai, and general fitness.</br>
I also have been running a DnD campaign for a group of nerds since 2022.

I love coffee.</br>
I particularly enjoy the light, fruity roasts that come out of my Aeropress.

As of Spring 2022, I am a local member of [$FWB](https://fwb.help).

I grew up in Hong Kong where I attended Chinese International School. Then, I transferred to Groton School in Massachusetts from grades 10-12, and then studied at CMU.

Other bits of life I enjoy include: playing and making video games, Tom Misch's music, practicing guitar/bass/ukulele, snowboarding, the ocean, discovering new coffee shops and bars, and much much more.
