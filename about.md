# About Me

My name is JJ, and I am 22 years old!

I love writing software. </br>
In spring 2022, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) with University Honors, earning a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a minor in Computer Science.
I am also projected to graduate with an M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering during the spring of 2023.

Illustration is my main hobby these days ([@jjchengart](https://twitter.com/jjchengart) IG + Twitter).</br>
In my spare time, I train Muay Thai, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and general fitness.</br>
I also have been running a DnD campaign for a group of nerds.

I love coffee.</br>
I particularly enjoy the light, fruity roasts that come out of my Aeropress.

As of Spring 2022, I am a local member of [$FWB](https://fwb.help).

I grew up in Hong Kong where I attended Chinese International School. Then, I transferred to Groton School in Massachusetts from grades 10-12, and then studied at CMU.

Other bits of life I enjoy include: Tom Misch's music, playing guitar/bass/ukulele, snowboarding, the ocean, discovering new coffee shops and bars, Critical Role, Valorant, and much much more.
