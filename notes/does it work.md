# does it work

yes it does. thank goodness.

Finally updated my personal website, and it feels great. The old one was handbuilt with React.

Not only was that solution overkill, but updating and maintaining a react site was much harder than these markdown files.

If you are building a lightweight website, do yourself a favor and stick to a static site generator.
