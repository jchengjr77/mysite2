## Started a Youtube

My housemate [nang](https://www.youtube.com/c/nang88) finally convinced me to start a youtube channel.

I'm pretty busy with school and my hobbies, so committing to an actual channel that posts nice, edited videos was too much. However, I realized that what I AM doing regularly is drawing.

Why not just... stream it.

My channel will simply be a bunch of drawing livestreams over lofi, and maybe some youtube shorts clipped from the streams, just to appeal to the algorithm a bit.

If you're reading this and haven't seen the channel yet, go check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCup1DEEy4xC6wqoiCwqqV3g).
