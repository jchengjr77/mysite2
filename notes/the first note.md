## The First Note

I was drawing in procreate today, and I turned off pressure opacity. One of the best decisions I've made so far.

(Context: pressure opacity allows your penstroke to be lighter or darker depending on how hard you press.)

Without the safety net of soft transparent lines, I can no longer chicken scratch. No more scrambling for the correct stroke through trial and error. Every time I put stylus to screen, it makes a bold black line.

Drawing without pressure opacity is daunting. It forces me to think about my line before I put it down. Decisions matter.
